\begin{ldef}
The active degree of a node $u$ is indicated by $\alpha(u)$.
\end{ldef}
\begin{ldef}
$\delta$ is the largest active degree in the graph.
\end{ldef}
\begin{ldef}
If $\alpha(u) = \delta$, each neighbor of $u$ has an active degree of $\gamma$. Formally, $\active(u) = \delta \implies \alpha (v) = \gamma \forall v | e(u,v) \in E$ for a graph G(V,E).
\end{ldef}
