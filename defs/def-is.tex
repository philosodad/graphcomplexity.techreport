Given an undirected graph G(V,E), an {\bfseries Independent Set} of G is a subset $V' \subset V | \forall e(u,v) \in E, u \in V' \implies v \notin V'$. A maximum independent set would be an Independent set of G with the maximum possible nodes, and the maximum weighted independent set is an inpendent set of a vertex weighted graph such that $\sum_{v \in V'} w(v)$ is the maximum possible over all independent sets of G.
