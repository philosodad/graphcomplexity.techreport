Sequential Linear time algorithms for covering problems are surveyed in detail in \cite{254190}. The seminal paper on Linear Programming techniques for constant ratio approximation of MWVC was published by Bar-Yehuda and Even in 1981 \cite{Bar-Yehuda:1981lr}. Gonzalez created a 2-optimal LP-Free linear time algorithm based on Maximal Matching in 1995 which is the basis of our distributed algorithm \cite{Gonzalez1995129}. 

We are aware of two distributed algorithms for minimum weighted vertex cover. A 2-optimal algorithm based on maximal matching was published in 2008 by Grandoni et. al \cite{1435381}. Their algorithm is based on the Maximal Matching algorithm of Israeli and Itai \cite{Israel:1986:FSR:5361.5365}, which uses a very similar approach to our own. We implement a simpler algorithm presented by Koufaganis and Young in 2009 for performance comparison \cite{1582746}. The Koufaganis/Young algorithm is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:k-y-alg}.

The network lifetime problem is introduced in detail by Cardei et. al in \cite{1498475}. A mathematical analysis of the problem is provided by Legakis et all in \cite{4697802}. Brinza and Zelikovski's deterministic algorithm \cite{1640702}, detailed in Section~\ref{sec:deeps} is used in this paper as a point of comparison. The issue of communication costs is addressed by Zhao et. all, along with a formal definition for the {\em Connected Target Coverage Problem}\cite{1514028}. Dhawan and Prasad introduce the use of Dependency Graphs for the network lifetime problem in \cite{978-3-540-77220-0_36}, this work provides the jumping off point for the algorithm introduced in Section~\ref{sec:PCDG}. Dependency Graphs are explored further in Section~\ref{sec:dep-graphs}.
